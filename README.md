This is my version of the Lambazon web app for Projet2 of Openclassrooms "back-end .NET app developer" studies.

This web app is using .NET 9.0.
It could be launched by cloning the project on Visual Studio.

In this exercice, I had to add different features of the application to make users able to add item to a cart or select the language of the app.
I also fixed the gestion of the stocks by reducing the number of items available after a purchase or preventing a product that is out of stock from being added to the cart.
